SNES Tutorial/Reference Infobase rev. 1.50
------------------------------------------
Maintained by Qwertie (QwertMan@hotmail.com)

New in 1.50
	- Combined directories Registers and Graphics into a single folder
	  called "MMIO&PPU".  If you don't know what that means, this is
	  probably not a good infobase for light reading in your spare time.
	- Revised MMIO and PPU document, and renamed it from Graphics.html
	  to QSNESDoc.html.  It's in the MMIO&PPU directory.
	- Added my document on dynamic recompilation (Misc/Logs)
	- Added small transparency doc under MMIO&PPU
	- Maybe some other stuff...
	- Memory folder renamed MemMap
New in 1.30:
	- Removed duplicate documents (the calb. combined Yoshi docs, and
	  the sub-docs that duplicate parts of 65c816.txt)
	- Revised my graphics.html doc a bit.
	- Added two good, new, *large* docs on the 65c816, in HTML format.
	  I'll remove them if I find that the original authors don't want 
	  them distributed.
New in 1.20:
	- New, large document, written by yours truly... gives a COMPLETE
	  explanation of basic SNES graphics and all the registers that
	  control basic graphics, plus some DMA stuff.  It's cross-
	  linked all over the place in HTML format; go to Graphics\ to
	  find it.
	- Added logs of my discussions with zsKnight: see Misc\Logs.
New in 1.01:
	- I've decided it's hopeless to do the big tutorial thing like
	  I wanted, so I'm gonna put up the version number so that
	  this edition looks "official".  And it is.  This is the
	  first "official" release.
	- Many more logs have been added, and I've added some of my
	  own notes to clarify some SNES topics.
New in 0.03:
	- A bunch of email logs that might be helpful (Misc\Logs)
	- A few SPCtodo notes in sound.txt
New in 0.02:
	- New doc on proposed 65c816 assembly standard
	- One or two things I can't remember

While there are several little reference documents on the Super NES, I 
have yet to find a _single_ tutorial on SNES programming or emulation.
Ugh.  But this set of documents should ease your pain somewhat.

If you are running a emu web site that gets a lot of hits, it would be
nice if you would link to the latest version of this archive on your 
site, (<a href="http://Qwertie.home.ml.org/snesbase.zip">)
or if you would link to the page for this database, which should
be: http://Qemu.home.ml.org/snesbase.html

ReadMe.txt - You should read it first
