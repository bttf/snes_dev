Welp music doesn't seem to be too bad. There is a really good musik ripper
on rhe Amiga that rips music out of SMC or BIN formats. I forgett the name,
since I don't have an Amiga :( .. oh well .. anyhoo here is some sample
source for playing a .SPC on the spc700 in the snez .. it's pretty
choppy but it's what I use.

Anhyhoo .. that's the same shit but a little clearer. Now the only propblem
with all this is you can't use your own musak .. 'cuz I don't know anyonwe
who knows the format or even if a composer exists. But, my original
post refered to samples and sound effects. 'cuz I don't knowe  ANYONE
wjho knows who those work 100% .. oh well .. ttyl
