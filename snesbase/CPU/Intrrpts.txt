
	Interrupt Processing Sequence


The interrupt processing sequence is initiated as the direct result of hard-
vare Abort, Interrupt Request, Non-Maskable Interrupt, or Reset inputs.
The interrupt sequence can also be initiated as a result of the Break or
Co-Processor instructions within the software. The following listings
describe the function of each cycle in the interrupt processing sequence:


Hardware Interrupt /ABORT, /IRQ, /NMI, /RES Inputs

Cycle No.

Notes:
	[1] Delete this cycle in Emulation mode.
	[2] Abort writes address of aborted opcode.
	[3] R/W remains in the high state during Reset.
	[4] In Emulation mode, bit 4 written to stack is changed to 0.
