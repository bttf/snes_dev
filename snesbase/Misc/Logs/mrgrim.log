<Qwerty> hiya there
<Qwerty> I've been wanting to do a snes emu for some time
<Qwerty> I want to know, how do u do a SNES CPU emulation core??
<Qwerty> I would start but I need information!!!
<Qwerty> about the vid-mode proggie: the top of the screen goes above the monitor!
<Qwerty> The screen is skinny and tall on my monitor
<Qwerty> it looks like eSNES before LordEsnes fixed it
<MrGrim> mess with the moniter controls for a little bit... see if that fixes it
<Qwerty> My monitor has no controls, except for bright & contrast
<Qwerty> its an old vga
<MrGrim> yuk... check the back..
<MrGrim> this proggie uses vesa 1.2 d00d.. =)
<Qwerty> well
<Qwerty> there r screwdriver controls in the back
<MrGrim> there's no hope...
<MrGrim> get a svga.. =)
<Qwerty> well, esnes fixed it...
<Qwerty> NESticle isn't so tall
<Qwerty> as your version of the mode
<Qwerty> it just needs tweaking...
<MrGrim> it's the mode
<MrGrim> 256x256
<MrGrim> neither uses it
<MrGrim> and they don't use VESA either
<Qwerty> NESticle runs in 256x256
<Qwerty> and it looks ok
<MrGrim> I need a SVGA for page flipping
<Qwerty> do you have tweak16b?
<MrGrim> I might add a standard VGA 256x256
<Qwerty> RU using mode X or the linear tweaked mode?
<Qwerty> You should use mode Q. it rules...
<MrGrim> linear
<Qwerty> ok
<MrGrim> it set's VESA 320x200x256 first
<MrGrim> that's probaly why
<Qwerty> so it needs a bit of tweaking for some monitors...
<MrGrim> no..
<MrGrim> VGA doesn't use VESA
<MrGrim> VESA is a SVGA standard
<Qwerty> ya...so?
<MrGrim> that's why
<Qwerty> Ok
<Qwerty> the proggie says "now going into 256x256x256"
<MrGrim> talk to _Demo_, he's doing the graphic's
<Qwerty> ?
<Qwerty> he's doing the graphics emulation?
<MrGrim> he's the graphic's coder in grimsnes
<MrGrim> he will do most
<Qwerty> ok
<MrGrim> I will work on CPU and SPC
<MrGrim> and void will do a sound mixer
<Qwerty> how do u work together like that?
<Qwerty> wow
<Qwerty> you guys sound like u have a plan :)
<MrGrim> yup
<Qwerty> well like i was saying
<Qwerty> I want to know, how do u do a SNES CPU emulation core?
<Qwerty> I need information!
<Qwerty> What r ure sources
<MrGrim> I'll send u trep's source
<MrGrim> that's what I learned from
Bargle: Dcc CHAT Auto Closed
<Qwerty> does he have all opcodes implemented?
<MrGrim> 100 and somethin'
<MrGrim> but you'll get the idea of how it's done
MrGrim: DCC Send tsnessrc.zip (207.79.146.69)
<Qwerty> is that enough to run any comercial games?
<Qwerty> do u have someplace where other codes are listed?
<MrGrim> yes
<MrGrim> you want to make a snes emu?
<Qwerty> yes actually
<Qwerty> I want to make the best thing since NESticle :)
<MrGrim> shit I lost it
<MrGrim> search in yahoo
<MrGrim> that's where I found it
<Qwerty> for what?
<Qwerty> what keywords?
<MrGrim> 65c816.txt
<MrGrim> every single opcode
<MrGrim> register
<MrGrim> complete specs
<Qwerty> hm... maybe it would be in an ftp search?
<Qwerty> I'm checking altavista
<Qwerty> Word count: 65c816 txt: 2
<MrGrim> hmm...

<Qwertie> I've got all the ref. docs off terri.oulu.fi but I don't get it... oh ya I'm starting a SNES emu
<Qwertie> :)
<MrGrim> well...
<MrGrim> go to yahoo and search for 65c816
<MrGrim> that's where I got a processor file
<Qwertie> I got that doc...
<MrGrim> lemme send you trps source to trepsnes
<MrGrim> and a sound doc
<Qwertie> I got that too
<Qwertie> u forgot didn't u? u sent me that already =)
MrGrim: DCC Send spc.htm (207.79.146.57)
<MrGrim> trep's source?
<Qwertie> SPC doc?
<MrGrim> that's all I needed
<MrGrim> that's enuff
<Qwertie> really
<Qwertie> I must be not quite as smart as you...
<Qwertie> do you have some previous experience with snes
<Qwertie> Oh yeah, and I don't have a coauthor...
<Qwertie> I have to understand the whole darn system
<MrGrim> no previous experiance
<MrGrim> those doc's are the whole system
<Qwertie> well
<Qwertie> its kinda going over me
<Qwertie> like, uh... what is HiROM, LoROM, VRAM, HiRAM, LoRAM, the weird "port" things and all that?
<MrGrim> heh....
