<_Demo_> what do you want to know about the snes?
<Qwertie> yup
<_Demo_> yup?
<Qwertie> yep
<Qwertie> did you read my !sneswish?
<_Demo_> you want to know yep?
<_Demo_> interesting
<_Demo_> i read it
<_Demo_> i can answer what you want, just ask
<Qwertie> ok. Question 1.
<Qwertie> The VRAM is the stuff that holds graphics, right? How is it accessed? How much of it is there?

<_Demo_> what do you want to know?
<Qwertie> oh hi demo
<Qwertie> remember me?
<_Demo_> hi
<_Demo_> yes
<Qwertie> My damn Aunt turned off my computer that one day... I lost the DCC log hehe
<_Demo_> btw erase all this highrom thing i said you from your memory it was almost 100% false
Nuxx has left IRC
<_Demo_> ok
<_Demo_> what do you want to know today?
<Qwertie> uhm
<Qwertie> the opcode format I think
<Qwertie> and, is there an equivalent IN/OUT command for 65c816?
<Qwertie> or do you just write to certain mem. locations?
<_Demo_> you just write to certain mem locations
<Qwertie> ok
<Qwertie> now the opcode format..?
<_Demo_> the opcode format?
<Qwertie> yes... how are the machine language instructions formatted?
<_Demo_> well every opcode is one byte
<Qwertie> I'm particularly interested in wtf those addressing modes are/mean
<_Demo_> and the operand depands of the addressing mode
<_Demo_> well they are how you get the operand
<Qwertie> ok... for example?
<Qwertie> lesse...
<_Demo_> huh
<_Demo_> i don't have my 65816 docs handy
<_Demo_> but if you have let say MOV A,ABS
<_Demo_> then you know by the opcode IT'S MOV A,
<_Demo_> ABS
<_Demo_> and absolute is an addressing mode

<Qwertie> hi again
<Qwertie> had  a problem
<Qwertie> now then is ADC the only add instruction?
<_Demo_> yes
<Qwertie> anyways... how is this instruction manual formatted?
<Qwertie> er why did I put that word "manual" in that sentence? hehe nm that
<_Demo_> well adc is a byte wich represents what to add and where to add it
<Qwertie> this doc is not very explanitory... hehe
<Qwertie> monicM/XE=1 orE = 0 and               dir, dir, (dir) (dir, (dir) [dir] abs abs, abs, absl absl d,s (d,s)E=0 and M/X=1M/X = 0Immed Accu dir   x    y          x)   ,y               x    y        ,x        ,yN V M X D I Z CADCPmAL + B + Pc -> ALA + W + Pc -> A 69        65   75         72    61   71    67    6D  7D   79   6F   7F   
<Qwertie> ^ ???
<_Demo_> well when you understand it, it is enough...
<Qwertie> so in a asm program, how would you use it?
<_Demo_> adc?
<_Demo_> adc A,10 
<_Demo_> for example
<Qwertie> adc #$01
<Qwertie> that's from a source file....
<Qwertie> so it can have 1 or 2 operands?
<_Demo_> huh, i don't remember
<_Demo_> i think the first is alway A
<Qwertie> so its optional eh?
<Qwertie> can't you add with X&Y?
<_Demo_> yeah
<_Demo_> i don't think so..
<_Demo_> (i'm not sure, i'm more in spc things now...)
<Qwertie> ok... well, so how is it formatted in machine bytes?
<_Demo_> well something LIKE AB 01 00 
<_Demo_> for adc 01
<Qwertie> the first byte is an opcode.... lesse...
<Qwertie> dang this doc doesn't explain it?
<Qwertie> what are these columns in this table?
<Qwertie> Immed Accu dir <--- ???
<Qwertie> uh what is the 00? MSB of the word?
<_Demo_> Immediate, Accumulator direct
<Qwertie> what's that mean?
<Qwertie> does this ADC instruction have an addressing mode btw?
<_Demo_> ok
<_Demo_> what are your docs?
<Qwertie> I'm looking at 85c816.txt now
<Qwertie> it's the ONLY CPU doc i have
<Qwertie> all the rest are SPC, memory map and PPU docs
<_Demo_> i hope it's 65c816.txt
<Qwertie> uh yes
<Qwertie> it is
<_Demo_> ok
<Qwertie> didn't i just say that?
<_Demo_> 85c816.txt
<_Demo_> ...
<_Demo_> ok
<_Demo_> there are 256 opcodes
<Qwertie> yup
<_Demo_> 80 or so instructions
<Qwertie> are they all used?
<_Demo_> and 21 addressing mode
<_Demo_> no, 2 are not...
<Qwertie> wait... there are 254 opcodes and only 80 instructions ?
<_Demo_> and 21 addressing mdoes
<_Demo_> modes
<Qwertie> uh... welll, if there's only 80 instructions, then what are the other 174 opcodes?
<_Demo_> they are the same instructions with different addressing modes
<Qwertie> ohhhhk
<Qwertie> so each opcode (1 byte) tells both the opcode and addressing mode
<Qwertie> which means... the each of the instructions has only a few addressing modes?
<Qwertie> because 80 x 24 is a lot more than 256
<_Demo_> yes
<_Demo_> that's it
<_Demo_> some instructions like brk have only one addressing mode but other can have more than 10...
<Qwertie> what does BRK do?
<Qwertie> it's mentioned a lot hehe
<_Demo_> it stop 
<Qwertie> it what? and what is the operand?
<_Demo_> i don't know but it has a one byte operand
<_Demo_> i think it's not used
<Qwertie> if it doesn't have a used operand.. then doesn't thsat mean it has 0 addressing moes?
<_Demo_> well something like that...
<Qwertie> now this add instruction.... you gave the example of adding a constant... can't it also add registers?
<Qwertie> what about mem locations?
<_Demo_> it can
<_Demo_> this is why there are addressing modes..
<Qwertie> if you add a register instead of a constant, then it would use a different opcode right?
<_Demo_> yes
<Qwertie> and for adding mem locations there would be several opcodes
<Qwertie> one for each addressing mode that is supported right?
<_Demo_> yes
<_Demo_> that's it
<Qwertie> uh ok.  now about "emulation mode"?
<Qwertie> do I have to worry about that?
<_Demo_> yes
<_Demo_> it changes the size of the A,X,Y
<Qwertie> and it would also change instruction size right?
<Qwertie> like ADC would be like AB 01 now
<_Demo_> yes
<Qwertie> would it be a good idea to write a separate emulation routines for the emulation/native modes?
<Qwertie> and, is there a way to access 8 bits in native mode like on the x86? (eg AL/AH)
<_Demo_> yes it would be a good idea
<_Demo_> no
<Qwertie> hmm. what if you want to add a byte to a 16-bit register? how would u do that?
<_Demo_> you can't 
<Qwertie> dang
<Qwertie> it sounds like certain things are....difficult on the SNES
<Qwertie> to program that is
<_Demo_> well, not that hard
<Qwertie> and can you move bytes around in memory in native moed?
<_Demo_> yes
<Qwertie> can you move words around in emulation mode?
<Qwertie> and is there direct memory transfers on the snes or do u have do like MOV A, mem1  ... MOV mem2, A like on the x86?
<_Demo_> huh
<_Demo_> you can use DMA
<_Demo_> but i don't think there are opcodes for moving 2 memory..
<Qwertie> isn't DMA for moving large blocks?
<Qwertie> and.. what is the mnemonic for the mov-type instruction?
<_Demo_> well there is no mov
<_Demo_> there are LDA STA,LDX STX,LDY STY ...
<Qwertie> yikes
<Qwertie> uhm... how did u learn 65c816 asm?
<Qwertie> I would like a book... but can't find 1
<_Demo_> i learned by looking at docs, experimenting and what ready helped was some 6502 knowledge that i got on the C64...
<_Demo_> ready =realy
<Qwertie> oh..
<Qwertie> well I don't have 6502 knowledge either...
<_Demo_> have you tryed MI .20?
<Qwertie> what?
<Qwertie> what's that
<_Demo_> Mario Improvement
<Qwertie> like i said um... whats that?
<_Demo_> http://www.goecities.com/SiliconValley/Bay/2628
<Qwertie> spelled wrong...hehe

<_Demo_> what is the real address of the site?
<Qwerty> ]http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Arcade/4777/snesbase.html
<Qwerty> er, http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Arcade/4777/snesbase.html
<Qwerty> having trouble accessing it?
<_Demo_> yep
<_Demo_> i can't access it with the other address...
<Qwerty> ml.org sux
<_Demo_> wow, my name is on the page
<Qwerty> =)
<Qwerty> can you answer any of those q's I got there?
<_Demo_> sure, let me check
<_Demo_> ok, first i don't have a tutorial, sorry
<_Demo_> VRAM is 64k, it is accessed with snes ports
<Qwerty> thats why I'm looking for people to write some..
<Qwerty> ok... what sorts of things are the vram used for
<_Demo_> Addressing modes are the way for an opcodes to know where to read or write the data
<Qwerty> for example?
<_Demo_> opcodes are composed of instructions and addressing modes
<Qwerty> ok..
<_Demo_> the vram is used to display all you see on the screen
<Qwerty> so, the snes has just 64K video ram?
<_Demo_> yep
<Qwerty> but this video ram isn't the same as on a PC right
<Qwerty> I mean, its not just a grid of pixels
<_Demo_> well, the way it is used, no
<_Demo_> no, it
<_Demo_> 's not a grid of pixels
<_Demo_> the pictures are in tiles
<Qwerty> I understand there can be different sizes of tiles...?
<_Demo_> yep, that's it, the size can be set by some other ports..
<Qwerty> are there different color depths for tiles?
<_Demo_> yes
<Qwerty> like what? I think there's 2-bit, 4-bit
<Qwerty> and 8-bit only in mode 7..?
<_Demo_> yep
<Qwerty> okay, is there a monochrome depth?
<_Demo_> i don't think so
<Qwerty> ok.. now, can you organise the VRAM any way you want? or do you have to put the color tables, tiles, etc. in specific locations
<_Demo_> you specify the locations with your program..
<Qwerty> ok.. now there are 4 'layers' right? the BGs?
<Qwerty> and 8 video modes?
<_Demo_> yes

<Qwerty> is that #coders channel good
<_Demo_> want to know some other things? (btw, i'm working at the same time so it may take some time before answers..)
<_Demo_> coders is, well, not too bad but not console related..
<Qwerty> yeps...
<Qwerty> um... ok, how is LoROM organised?
<Qwerty> and HiROM?
<_Demo_> well, low rom is from 00-3f in 32k banks
<_Demo_> starting at 8000h
<Qwerty> so ROM address 0-32K at 008000-00FFFF?
<Qwerty> and ROM address 32-64K at 018000-01FFFF etc?
<_Demo_> yep
<Qwerty> what about HiROM?
<Qwerty> ahem?
<_Demo_> it starts at bank 40 and use all the mem
<Qwerty> um... 400000-40FFFF=0-64K, 410000-41FFFF=64-128K ?
<Qwerty> so you would have maximum ROM space of 4 MB??

<QwertPing> Got disconnected again!
<QwertPing> anyway, so about HiROM?
<_Demo_> you were right about it..
<QwertPing> I had thought HiROM was used in the large games because it allowed more storage space... but LoROM would have a max of 4 MB also, wouldn't it?
<QwertPing> (32K * 128 banks)
<_Demo_> *64 banks not 128
<QwertPing> oh? so you can't use banks 40-80 in LoROM? do ya know why not?
<_Demo_> you can't use them
<QwertPing> darn, gotta go.. church :)

<_Qwertie> hello?
<_Demo_> hello
<_Qwertie> I've been emailing somebody named Jason about snes info...
<_Qwertie> who's working with savory snax who's doing sneese...
<_Demo_> ok
<_Qwertie> Oh ah... yes, it runs from ROM, and the program, unless specified
<_Qwertie> otherwise by the "reset vector" in the game header (not the SMC
<_Qwertie> header, but the game header which comprises the last 64 bytes of the
<_Qwertie> first bank of the ROM), starts execution at 0x8000 in bank 0x00. Both
<_Qwertie> in LoROM and in HiROM
<_Qwertie> (a bit of info I got from him)
<_Qwertie> anyway, does that look right?
<_Demo_> yes, it is right
<_Qwertie> because if HiROM starts in bank 0x40, there's no ROM at 0x00-8000..
<_Qwertie> therefore execution cant start there eh?
<_Demo_> well, maybe it can but i have never seen a game starting there
<_Qwertie> um...well where does it start
<_Demo_> it starts in bank 40 i think, but i'm not sure about that
<_Qwertie> so what this would mean is, it always starts at the first available ROM address?
<_Demo_> no, it starts at the reset vector address
<_Qwertie> oh..er..yeah
<_Qwertie> ok nm then
<_Qwertie> do you know what the interval (# of clock cycles) between IRQs, NMIs etc is? or where I can find out?
<_Demo_> hmm, i don't know the values exactly
Herbman is on IRC
<_Demo_> need something else?
<_Qwertie> oh, if you want I can think of lots of stuff
<_Qwertie> such as, how the joypad gets read..
<_Demo_> it is read via a register

<_Qwertie> How does a game tell if it's running on a PAL/NTSC NES?
<_Qwertie> er SNES
Herbman is on IRC
<_Qwertie> or how does it tell if its on a Japanese one or NA
<_Demo_> hmm, i don't remember
<_Qwertie> this makes me remember a quote from some movies... "You have outlasted your usefulness to me" Gun raises.... ptewy! ugnh.
<_Demo_> hmmm
<_Qwertie> =)
<_Qwertie> I heard there was a 48 MBit game somewhere.  Heard anything about it?
<_Demo_> yes, i heard about it
<_Demo_> do you have djgpp on your hd?
<_Qwertie> nope, I went to this distro site... couldnt figure out which files to get and how the heck to use the thing
