So many register docs, so little time... so I combined them!  A bit primitive,
maybe, but it's better than before... the doc that was in all capital letters 
says "Appendix XxX" a lot.. Guess what?  There AREN'T ANY!!  Also, I hope you
don't mind but I put sme of the regsiters out of order to make it easier to 
understand--eg all the multiplication regs are grouped together etc.

P.S. I got this whole thing to print on 8 sheets of one-sided 8.5x11" paper.. :^P
'Course I could hardly read it after that...

|     |       |This is an intruiging register. Like the types define, it has |
|     |       |to be written to twice: The first byte holds the first 8 bits,|
|     |       |and the second byte holds the last 3 bits. This makes a total |
|     |       |of 11 bits for information. This only proves true for MODes   |
|     |       |0 to 6. MODE 7 uses 13 bits instead of 11. As long as you're  |
|     |       |not in MODE 7, you can store $00 in the 2nd byte for a smooth |

          The Center Coordinate (X0,y0) for Rotation/enlargement/reduction
       Can Be Designated by this Register.

          The Coordinate Value of X0 & Y0 Can Be Designated by 13-bit
       (Complement of 2).

          The Register Requires That the Lower 8-bit is Set First and the
       Upper 5-bit is Set. Therefore, 13-bit Data in Total Can Be Set.

          This Register is Used to Designate the Channel Out of 8-channels.

          The Channel Which Should Be Used Can Be Designated by Writing "1"
       To the Bit of this Channel. As Soon As "1" is Written to the
       Bit (After A Few Cycles Passed), the General Purpose Dma Transfer
       Will Be Started.

          When the General Purpose Dma of the Designated Channel is
          Completed, the Flag Will Be Cleared.

     Note:     Because the Data Area (Register <4300>-) of Each Channel
     ~~~~~     is Held in Common with the Data of Each H-dma Channel, the
          Channel Designated by the H-dma Channel Designation
          Register <420ch> Can Not Be Used.
          (It is Prohibited to Write "1" to the Bit of the Channel)
          Therefore, 8 Channels (Ch0-ch7) Should Be Assigned by the
          H-dma and the General Purpose Dma)

     Note:     If the H-blank Come During the Operation of the General
     ~~~~~     Purpose Dma and the H-dma is Started, the General Purpose
          Dma Will Be Discontinued in the Middle, and Re-started Right
          After the H-dma is Complete.

     Note:     If 2 Or More Channels Are Designated, the Dma Transfer Will
     ~~~~~     Be Performed Continously According to the Priority Described
          in Appendix-1.
          And Also, the Cpu Stops Operation Until All the General

       Set by the Absolute Addressing Mode Or the Indirect Addressing
       Mode.

          This Address Becomes the Basic Address on the A-bus During Dma
       Transfer Period, and the Address Will Be Increased Or Decreased
       Based on this Address. (When the General Purpose Dma is Performed
       It Will Be Decreased.)

          this is A Register Which the Indirect Address Will Be

          The Indirect Address Means the Data Address Described
          on Appendix-2. It is Not Necessary to Read Or Write
          Directly by the Cpu Except in Special Cases.

          In Case of General Purpose Dma
          this is the Register, Which Can Set the Number of Byte
          to Transfer Or to Be Transfered. However, the Number of
          Byte "0000h" Means "10000h".

          The Data of These Registers Are Used As the Basic Address Which
       Is the Addresss Set by the "A1 Table Address". Afterwards,
       Because it Will Be Increased Or Decreased Automatically, it is
       Necessary to Set the Address Into this Register by the Cpu
       Directly.

     Following Apply to H-dma Only:
          However, If the Data Which is Transfered Need to Be Changed
          by Force, it Can Be Done by Setting the Cpu Memory Address
          to this Register. And Also, the Address of the Cpu Which is
          Accessed Currently Will Be Changed by Reading this Register.
