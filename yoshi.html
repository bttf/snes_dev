SNES Documentation v2.30: Written by Yoshi
****************************************************************************
        Well, seems like you're interested in the SNES programming world.
 
        First off, learn 65c816 assembly. This document will probably be
        WAY over your head if you don't even understand basic opcodes. I
        don't plan on adding a "how.to.code.in.65c816" section to this
        document, *EVER*. Learn it yourself. I can help you with it, but
        you need to learn the basics yourself. It's worth it in the long-
        run, trust me.
 
        This document currently covers more than ANY other document i've
        ever seen: No, i'm not bragging. I'm stating a fact. I'm proud to be
        the one to release this information, too. I feel everyone has the
        right to know about all of this, especially if they're interested in
        getting a career in the SNES-world.
 
        If you have any information to send me, such as typo comments, or
        information which is "wrong" or *NEW* information, do so! I'm always
        updating this thing: the more the better. It's looking great so
        far, and I plan on keeping the rate-of-progress steady.
 
        For more information about moi, read on! :-)
****************************************************************************
        I'm 17 years old; brown hair, blue/grey eyes. 5 foot 10 inches
        tall (175cm), 145 pounds (62.25kg). I am currently in my 5th
        year of high school (I failed my senior year), attending Corvallis
        High School in Corvallis, Oregon.
 
        I'm currently without a job, but i'd love to do development work
        in a CS-related job, ESPECIALLY SNES-related. I'm available! :-)
 
        In my spare time, I enjoy writing stories (books, if you must know.
        I love writing, so...), SNES documentation (ha ha ha), programming
        (in just about anything and everything), biking, sleeping, sketch-
        ing, and IRCing. You can *ALWAYS* find me on IRC at just about ANY
        time of the day. Leave me a /MSG -info note (which is sent to me
        via EMail, FYI), and i'll get it when I log in to check my mail.

        As of January 24th, 1995, I will be 18 years old. I'm not employed
        (vs. unemployed, where you've actually HAD a job). Dunno what'll
        happen to me. Maybe i'll die. Who knows. I hope to move in with
        a good friend of mine, but i'm too chicken to ask. I'd rather be
        out on the street w/out foot than be told "No you can't" - it's a
        huge flaw in my philosophy... Sorry.

|Words in brackets ( [] ) are the official "names" of the registers          |
|Words in braces ( {} ) are different from the "real" SNES manual            |
|Bits define 1 as "ON/ENABLE" and 0 as "OFF/DISABLE," unless otherwise stated|
|Registers without any bits/defined-data can be assumed to be 8 bits in size |
|and should only be read once.                                               |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|NOTE! I have renamed all occurances of "Plane {x}" to "BG{x+1}." This means |
|stuff like "Plane 2" is now referred to as "BG3" - This is how it is done   |
|(so i'm told) in the official SNES documentation, so for compatibility and  |
|comprehension, i've renamed everything.                                     |
|                                                                            |
|I have also renamed "Sprites" to "OBJ", "objects," or "OAM" for the same    |
|reason that I renamed "Plane" to "BG."                                      |

|     |       |This is an intruiging register. Like the types define, it has |
|     |       |to be written to twice: The first byte holds the first 8 bits,|
|     |       |and the second byte holds the last 3 bits. This makes a total |
|     |       |of 11 bits for information. This only proves true for MODes   |
|     |       |0 to 6. MODE 7 uses 13 bits instead of 11. As long as you're  |
|     |       |not in MODE 7, you can store $00 in the 2nd byte for a smooth |
|     |       |scrolling background.                                         |

|The SNES has some interesting colour characteristics. The colour, theoret-  |
|ically is 15 bit; each RGB value (Red, Green, and Blue) has 5 bits for each |
|colour.                                                                     |

|When it comes to putting the colour data into $2122, the format (in binary) |

|For those of you who don't know how the SNES does do it's graphics, it      |
|uses tiles (surprise surprise!).                                            |
|                                                                            | 
|There are different MODEs on the SNES; the most famous being MODE 7.        |
|Most people think that $2106 (Screen Pixelation: Look in SNES.1 for an ex-  |
|planation on this register) is MODE 7. *** THIS IS NOT MODE 7!!! ***.       |
|So, the next time the pixels get really "big" (almost making them look like |
|look like IBM-clone 320x200x256 MODE 13h graphics), and your friend says    |
|"WOW! MODE 7 is really awesome," punch him/her in the nose for me. Just     |
|joking. :-)                                                                 |
|                                                                            |
|I'll be explaining MODE 1. I know how MODE 7 works, but since i've never    |
|used it, don't plan on me explaining it in the near future. Sorry to those  |
|who were looking for a MODE 7 document. Look elsewhere...                   |
|                                                                            |
|MODE   # of BGs       MaxColour/Tile  Palettes      Colours                 |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|0      4              4               8             32                      |
|1      3              16/16/4         8             128                     |
|                                                                            |
|MODE 0 is good for geometric shapes (if you were going to rotate a wire-    |
|frame cube, or something like that), basic star scrolls, or a very 'bland'  |
|text scroller... it's pretty cool and doesn't take up much space.           |
|                                                                            |
|I'm going to explain MODE 1, since MODE 0 is the same thing but with less   |
|bitplanes. :-)                                                              |
|                                                                            |
|MODE 1 is really best for things; detailed star scrolls, text scrollers,    |
|geometric shapes, and filled objects. It's the most common used MODE in the |
|the professional SNES programming world.                                    |
|                                                                            |
|You need to "setup the plane" to tell it what tile goes where. If you want  |
|demo-code, check out 'test.asm' in 'test.lzh'.                              |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|So, lets assume we have a character (a 8x8 tile) which we want to work with |
|to figure out the SNES's colour scheme:                                     |
|                                                                            |
|TestCHR1       dcb $00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00 ; '@'                    |
|TestCHR2       dcb $00,$3C,$4E,$5E,$5E,$40,$3C,$00 ; '@'                    |
|                                                                            |
|You're probably wondering how the two lines above turn into actual graphic  |
|data on your monitor or television set. Very simple. Consider each byte     |

|The at-symbol ('@') is visible in TestCHR2. Now you're probably wondering   |
|"Well, that tells me how to define a pixel on and off; what about the colour|
|itself!" Once again, very simple, but a tad more complex:                   |
|                                                                            |
|If you have a 0 for bitplane 0, a 0 for bitplane 1, a 0 for bitplane 2,     |
|and a 0 for bitplane 3, you get color #0; eg.:                              |
|                       0000 = Color #0                                      |
|                       ||||___________Bitplane 0                            |
|                       |||__________Bitplane 1                              |
|                       ||_________Bitplane 2                                |
|                       |________Bitplane 3                                  |
|                                                                            |
|So, now, think about a 0 for bitplane 0, a 1 for bitplane 1 and 2, and a 0  |
|for bitplane 3:                                                             |
|                       0110 = Color #6                                      |
|                       ||||___________Bitplane 0                            |
|                       |||__________Bitplane 1                              |
|                       |_________Bitplane 2                                 |
|                       |________Bitplane 3                                  |
|                                                                            |
|Keep in mind, this is the best explanation i've ever seen done about SNES   |
|pixel color definition. Until I see better, I'd have to say this is the     |
|best it's gonna get.                                                        |
|The result above gives you the color # per pixel; it's interesting. It's an |
|"overlay" method, so-to-speak, not to confuse this w/ main and sub-screens. |

|Continue this table all the way down to OBJ #127 (out of 128). Don't think  |
|you're finished quite yet: There is one more table of data required.        |
|                                                                            |
|2 bits are defined for each OBJ (eg. byte #0 holds the info for OBJ 0, 1, 2,|
|and 3; byte #1 holds the info for OBJ 4, 5, 6, and 7). Therefore, 128/4 is  |
|32 bytes of data for the following table:                                   |
|                                  ab                                        |
|                                  ||____Size toggle bit.                    |
|                                  |_____MSB of X-position bit.              |
|                                                                            |
|So, the 4 bytes/sprites + the block are put into the OAM table by consec-   |
|utive writes to the OAM data register. You first should set the OAM address |
|to $0000, then shove your data into it.                                     |
|                                                                            |
|If you don't set the block after the OAM as well, the results are bad. All  |
|the data for the MSB stuff wouldn't be defined correctly, which would result|
|in your entire OBJ table being wacko. Have atleast some 0's there or a table|
|which you really want to use in the long run.                               |

        Jeremy Gordon: Thanks for supplying me your sprite documentation. I
                       don't think this doc. would be complete without it!
                       Also for 65816 v2.0! Excellent assembler.
            AntiTrack: Thanks for the source! Next time, i'll ask! (grin)
                Toshi: I know you can't say much due to your job, but I
                       really appreciate all the moral support you've given
                       me. I wish I could show you how much it means to me.
                minus: Work on TRASM some more! Fix' dem bugs! :-)
                 Jehu: Keep in touch. Get back to me about the job!
              Clay C.: Without you, who knows where i'd be.
                Troy_: I appreciate the logos!
